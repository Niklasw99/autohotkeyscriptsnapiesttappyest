V4 Is out now

!V4 is not as fast as V2 and does seem to lock up because of some logic issue at times. 
It's prob the least detectable so thats it so far...

V4 Added Variables for up press so when you release the key it does not press up unnessary.
DO NOTE that you still need debounce delay since autohotkey is fast but seems to be funky.

V3 added the option for debounce delay Default is 10ms you mostlikely want it higher

V2 added variables to stop up spam on key press

V1 Basic spam up of oppisite key
